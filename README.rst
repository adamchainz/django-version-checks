System checks for your project's environment.

Requirements
============

Python 3.6 to 3.9 supported.

Django 2.2 to 3.1 supported.

Installation
============

First, install with **pip**:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install django-version-checks

Second, add the app to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting:

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        "django_version_checks",
        ...
    ]

Third, add a ``VERSION_CHECKS`` setting with the version checks you want to enforce (as documented below).
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    VERSION_CHECKS = {
        "python": "==3.9.*",
    }

Usage
=====

django-version-checks adds several `system checks <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/checks/>`__ that can help ensure that the current environment has the right versions of Python, databases, etc.
This is useful when coordinating upgrades across all your infrastructure.

Note that django-version-checks does not check the versions of your Python dependencies.
This is because such checks need doing at the start of the Python process, in your `manage.py` file, before Django imports your apps.
Any mismatched versions are likely to cause import time problems, before django-version-checksâ€™ system checks can execute.
To add checks on your Python dependencies, check out `pip-lock <https://github.com/adamchainz/pip-lock/>`__.

Checks use the `PEP 440 specifier format <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#id53>`__ via the ``packaging`` module.
This is the same format used by pip, allowing you to specify flexible ranges.
Each check is documented below.

Each check ensures that its configuration has the expected type and valid specifiers.
If not, it will show one of these system check errors:

* ``dvc.E001``: ``<check>`` is misconfigured. Expected a ``<type>`` but got ``<value>``.
* ``dvc.E002``: ``<check>`` is misconfigured. ``<value>`` is not a valid PEP440 specifier.

``python`` check
----------------

This check compares the current version of Python to the specified range.
The range should be specified in a single string under the ``"python"`` key:

.. code-block:: python

    VERSION_CHECKS = {
        "python": "~=3.9.1"  # 3.9.1+, but less than 3.10
    }

If this check fails, the system check will report:

* ``dvc.E003``: The current version of Python (``<version>``) does not match the specified range (``<range>``).

Example Upgrade
===============

Letâ€™s walk through using django-version-checks to upgrade Python from version 3.8 to 3.9.
We have an infrastructure consisting of CI, staging, and production environments, and several developersâ€™ development machines.

First, we had a pre-existing check to ensure all environments are on Python 3.8:

.. code-block:: python

    VERSION_CHECKS = {
        "python": "~=3.8.6",
    }

Second, we rewrite the specifier to allow versions of Python 3.9:

.. code-block:: python

    VERSION_CHECKS = {
        "python": ">=3.8.6,<3.10.0",
    }

Third, we upgrade our infrastructure.
Weâ€™d probably upgrade in the order: CI, development environments, staging, production.
Each environment should have an automated run of ``manage.py check``, as per the `Django deployment checklist <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/deployment/checklist/>`__.

Fourth, we change the specifier again to allow Python 3.9 only:

.. code-block:: python

    VERSION_CHECKS = {
        "python": "~=3.9.1",
    }

And weâ€™re upgraded! ðŸŽ‰
